AVL is the world's largest independent company for the development, simulation and testing of powertrain systems (hybrid, combustion engine, transmission, electric drive, batteries, fuel cell and control technology) for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, construction, large engines and their integration into the vehicle. The company has decades of experience in the development and optimization of powertrain systems for all industries. 

As a global technology leader, AVL provides complete and integrated development environments, measurement and test systems as well as state-of-the-art simulation methods. As a pioneer in the field of innovative solutions, such as diverse electrification strategies for powertrains, AVL is increasingly taking on new tasks in the field of autonomous driving, especially on the basis of subjective human sensations (driveability, connectivity, ADAS, etc.). In the competition of technologies internal combustion engine, battery/electric drive and fuel cell and their combinations, AVL is working intensively and with the same priorities. 

AVL has digitized the vehicle development process with state-of-the art and highly scalable IT, software and technology platforms, and creates new customer solutions in the areas of big data, artificial intelligence, simulation and embedded systems in an agile and integrated development environment.
