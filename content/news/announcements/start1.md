We are glad to announce the start of our Eclipse Working Group.

<!--more-->

Taking advantage of the fact that the SUMO conference is being held, we have decided to start the activities of openMobility Working Group.

We will accomplish our goals by fostering and leveraging collaborations among members and by ensuring the development and availability of the “OpenMobility framework”. This framework will provide the tools for a detailed simulation of the movement of vehicles and people as well as their communication patterns. It will be valuable for testing driver assistance systems, predicting and optimizing traffic as well as evaluating new business concepts, such as Mobility-as-a-Service.
