# **Join Us!**

In order to participate in the OpenMobility working group, an entity must be at least a Solutions Member​ of the Eclipse Foundation, have executed the OpenMobility Participation Agreement, and adhere to the requirements.

The OpenMobility working group is open at any time to all new members who meet these conditions.

During the incubation phase, there are two classes of OpenMobility working group membership. Each of these classes is described in detail below.

#### Participant Members
Participant Members are typically organizations that view an open mobility simulation framework as strategic to their organization and are willing to invest significant resources to sustain and shape the activities of this working group. Typical Participant Members include industry users of the technologies and results provided by the OpenMobility working group.

#### Committer
Committer Members are individuals who through a process of meritocracy defined by the Eclipse Development Process are able to contribute and commit code to the Eclipse Foundation projects included in the scope of this working group. Committers may be members by virtue of working for a member organization, or may choose to complete the membership process independently if they are not. For further explanation and details, see the “Eclipse Committer Membership” ​page.
